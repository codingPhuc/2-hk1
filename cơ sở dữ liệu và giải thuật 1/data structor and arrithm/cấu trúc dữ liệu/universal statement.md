let Q(X)  be a predicate and D the domain of x.A universal statement of the form "Vx thuộc D , Q(x)"
- it is defined to be true iff Q(x ) is true for every x in D 
- it si defined to be false iff Q(x) is false for at least one x in D
A value for x for which Q( x) is false is called a counterexample 
# existentual statement 
let Q(x) be a predicate and D the domain of x . An exsitendtial statement is a statement of the form "Ex thuộc D suck that Q(x)" 
- it is defined to be true iff Q(x) is true for at leastone x in D. 
- it it defined to be false iff Q(x) is false for all x in D
  # universial conditional statements 
  A resonabe argument can be made that the most inportant form of statement in mathmatics is the universal conditional statement 
  Vx if p(x) then Q(x) 
  familiarity with statements of this form is essential if you are to learn to speak mathematics 
  # notation 
  let p(x) and Q(x) be predicates and support the common domain of x is D 
  - the notation P(x) -> Q(x) means that every element in the truth set of P(X) is in the truth set of Q(x) , or . equivalently , Vx , p(x)-> Q(x )
  - the notation P(x) -> Q(x) means that P(x) and Q(x) , ohave identical truth sets , or , equivalent , Vx , P(x) <-> Q(x)
