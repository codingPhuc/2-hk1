is that implication is used to indicate that one statement implies another statement, while equivalence is used to indicate that two statements are logically equivalent. Implication is a type of logical relationship between two statements, while equivalence is a type of logical relationship between two statements that are logically equivalent. In other words, implication is used to indicate that one statement implies another statement, while equivalence is used to indicate that two statements are logically equivalent.


For example, the statement "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" implies that if it is not raining, then the ground is not wet. This statement can be written as "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" ⇒ "If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet". On the other hand, the statement "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" is logically equivalent to the statement "If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining". This statement can be written as "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" ≡ "If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining".
